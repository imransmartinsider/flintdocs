# Contribution Guide

To promote active collaboration within the Flint community, we strongly encourage pull requests over bug reports. Pull requests should be marked as "ready for review" (not in "draft" state) and ensure all tests for new features are passing. Draft pull requests that remain inactive will be closed after a few days.

If you do need to file a bug report, please include a descriptive title and a detailed explanation of the issue. Provide as much relevant information as possible, along with a code sample that demonstrates the problem. This helps others replicate the issue and work towards a solution.

Bug reports are meant to foster collaboration with others who might be experiencing the same problem. There is no guarantee that your report will receive immediate attention or resolution. The purpose of creating a bug report is to initiate the process of fixing the issue, both for yourself and the community. If you’re willing, you can contribute by addressing any bugs listed in our issue trackers. To view all Flint issues, you need to be authenticated with GitHub.

For issues related to DocBlock, PHPStan, or IDE warnings while using Flint, please submit a pull request instead of creating a GitHub issue.

Flint’s source code is hosted on GitHub, with dedicated repositories for each project.
